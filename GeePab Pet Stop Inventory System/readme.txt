Developers:
We, as developers, worked on the GeePab Pet Stop Inventory and Order System Web Application. 
Our responsibilities included designing and implementing the user interface, developing the backend logic and functionality, 
integrating database management systems, implementing security measures such as encryption, 
and conducting testing and debugging of the application. 
We collaborated with GeePab Pet Stop's owner to gather requirements, 
designed and implemented various features, and ensured the overall functionality and usability of the application. 
We are grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this project and our combined efforts and expertise 
have resulted in a reliable and efficient inventory and order management system.

We would like to express our appreciation to our teacher, 
Sir Rics Rojas, for his guidance, support, and valuable insights throughout the development process. 
His expertise and mentorship have been instrumental in the successful completion of this project.
